# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project: Neighborhood Map
```
```
## Project Description:
- This project is the fifth major project for the Front-End Nanodegree Program by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). This application is a local neighborhood map listing some of the best ice cream spots around Irvine, California - ranging from the top rated establishments listed on Foursquare.

## Project Criteria
- Develop a single-page application featuring a map of a particular neighborhood.
- Add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list-view to support simple browsing of all locations.
- Research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
- Additional info can be listed in Udacity's [Neighborhood Map Rubric](https://review.udaebocity.com/#!/projects/2711658591/rubric)

```

## Intro
I first decided to draw inspiration through Github from other projects to understand the flow, design and methodologies of other developers who have also undertaken the same project for Udacity. This was to also get a better understanding of other build tools/APIs used for the development of the app, the additional resources they used to help build their projects, as well as the overview of their file organization and practice.
